As such, if we believe that our overall housing price data content may have been tangibly impacted by the financial crisis, we could create a binary indicator variable that flags every data item within the 2007-2012 time period as potentially having been impacted by the financial crisis (assigning a '1' as the indicator), while all other data items are assigned a '0' for the indicator variable's value.\n",

It should include any insights of the attributes and accompanying exploratory graphics (e.g., bar plots, box plots, histograms, line plots, etc.). It is up to you as the data science practitioner to decide how you go about your EDA, including selecting appropriate statistical metrics to be calculated and which types of exploratory graphics to make use of. You should also identify any and all potential data integrity issues (e.g., missing data values; invalid data values; etc.) and determine whether any data attributes might need to be transformed prior to being used within a machine learning model. Provide an EDA that is thorough and succinct without it being so detailed that a reader will lose interest in it. \n",

        "4. Perform appropriate data preparation tasks relative to the data integrity and usability issues identified via EDA work. Describe the ways in which you have transformed / prepared the data for use within a machine learning algorithm, e.g., have you deleted any observations? Used imputation to fill missing data values? Created any new variables? Transformed data via mathematical transforms (e.g., Box-Cox, logarithms, etc.) or binning? etc. Be sure to explain your justification for each adjustment you have made to the data.\n",
