As such, if any variable in your model is shown to have a  p value that exceeds 0.05, consider removing it from the model to see whether the fit/model selection metrics improve.  For instance, a null hypothesis for a coin would be that it is a fair coin, if we were to flip it and get ten heads in a row, it would be \"very strange\", we would have a very low p-value, and reject the null hypothesis.
